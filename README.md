Hello World!

My name is Seth Carroll, and I'm a fourth-year student, entering my final year at Northeastern this fall. 
I'm a combined Cognitive Psychology and Computer Science major, 
and I added the Computer Science part after 3 years as a Psychology major.

I will be co-oping as a mobile app developer at John Hancock Summer 2 and Fall, and it will be my third and final co-op.
Though I will be doing app development, and I'm pretty new to the field in general, I think I will enjoy web development.
The adaptibility, flexibility, and scalability of the web fascinates me, and I hope to enjoy the material in this course.


The purpose of this repository is to host my assignments and final project in the Web Development course.

The web application for these assignments and projects are hosted on Heroku at the following URL:
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/carroll-seth-webdev



I may add more content here in the future as is necessary and or fititng, but in the meantime I'll leave with this:

Thanks for the opportunity, and I look forward to this summer semester!
